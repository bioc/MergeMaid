Description: The functions in this R extension are intended for
        cross-study comparison of gene expression array data. Required
        from the user is gene expression matrices, their corresponding
        gene-id vectors and other useful information, and they could 
	be 'list','matrix','exprSet'. The main function is 'mergeExprs' 
	which transforms the input objects into data in the merged format, 
	such that common genes in different datasets can be easily found. 
	And the function 'intcor' calculate the correlation coefficients.
	Other functions use the output from 'modelOutcome' to graphically
        display the results and cross-validate associations of gene
        expression data with survival.
Depends: R (>= 1.5.0), survival, Biobase
